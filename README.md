# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains projects that implement deep learning algorithms. Each project is organized into its directory with relevant code and documentation.

## Projects

1. **Banana ripeness classifier**
   - This work implements a deep neural network to identify the ripeness level of Ecuadorian bananas. In addition, a small interface is implemented to perform the predictions uploading new images and sending prompts to ChatGPT about the output.
